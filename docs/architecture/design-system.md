# Design System

## Direction

UX patterns inspired by consumer fintech apps (clear progressive
steps, card-based transaction history, confirmation-first flows) —
kept honest about scope: this is pattern inspiration, not a
pixel-verified clone of any specific app, since no design tokens were
extracted from a live reference. The brand's own accent — a restrained
indigo-violet — replaced an earlier green palette that read as
generic/templated rather than banking-grade.

## Color tokens

Defined once in `tailwind.config.js` and `index.css`; every component
consumes the token, not a hardcoded hex value.

| Token | Dark (default) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `brand-500` | `#6c56e3` | Primary actions, links, brand mark |
| `success-500` | `#3d7ee8` | Verified/compliant states — a professional **blue**, not green, matching real banking "verified" badges |
| `navy-950` / `--canvas` | near-black | Page background |
| `--surface` | `#12141b` | Card/panel background |
| `--ink` / `--ink-muted` | near-white / grey | Primary / secondary text |

## Light mode

    C --> D["--canvas: #f7f7fb<br/>--surface: #ffffff<br/>--ink: #14161b"]
```

Implementation: `ThemeToggle.jsx` toggles a `.light` class on
`<html>` and persists the choice in `localStorage`. Rather than
prefixing every utility class with `dark:` across ~25 components (a
much larger undertaking), semantic CSS-variable tokens (`bg-canvas`,
`bg-surface`, `text-ink`, `text-ink-muted`, `border-hairline`) were
introduced and applied to the highest-traffic surfaces first —
**Navbar, Footer, and the Home page** — verified by screenshot in both
modes. The hero section deliberately keeps its own dark gradient in
both modes (a common, legitimate "dark hero over a light page"
pattern); its text is intentionally left as literal white rather than
tied to the theme token, since the section's background doesn't
change with it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remaining pages (Send Money, Payment, Track Transfer, Tamper Demo,
etc.) still use the original dark-only classes and have not yet been
converted to the semantic tokens. The pattern is established and
tested; extending it page by page is the natural next increment, not
a redesign from scratch.

## What changed and why

| Before | After | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Green accent (`brand`, `success`, plus 8 hardcoded hex values in `index.css`) | Indigo-violet accent throughout | Read as a generic AI/crypto template; a single restrained accent is closer to real banking-app convention |
| "Verified" = green | "Verified" = blue | Matches how banks and platforms (e.g. verified-account badges) typically signal trust — green was overloaded with the brand color it's now separate from |
| No light mode | Toggleable light mode on primary surfaces | Requested; implemented as a real, screenshot-verified feature rather than a superficial CSS filter |
